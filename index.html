   <h3 class="under_title">READING</h3>

   <p class="prgrf">Reading is one of my favorite ways to relax and disconnect. I enjoy getting lost in stories, exploring different perspectives, and learning new things through books. Whether it’s fiction or something more educational, reading helps me grow and think differently. It’s both an escape and a source of inspiration in my daily life.</p>

   <h3>MUSIC</h3>

   <p class="prgrf">Music is a big part of my life. It helps me express emotions that I sometimes can't put into words. Whether I’m listening to something upbeat to boost my energy or something calm to relax, there’s always a song that matches my mood. Music inspires me, keeps me grounded, and is always there for me, no matter what I’m going through.</p>

   <h3>MAKEUP</h3>

   <p class="prgrf">Makeup is more than just a routine—it’s something I truly enjoy. I see it as a form of art where I can play with colors and create different looks, from natural to bold. It gives me the chance to be creative, to highlight my features, and to have fun with my appearance. I love how even a small touch of makeup can change how I feel about myself.</p>

   <h3>FASHION</h3>

   <p class="prgrf">Fashion is my favorite way of showing who I am. I love experimenting with different styles, colors, and trends, and putting together outfits that feel uniquely me. It’s not just about looking good—it’s about feeling confident and expressing creativity through clothes. For me, fashion is like a visual diary of my personality and how I feel that day.</p>
